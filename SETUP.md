2. Go to your Dashboard
3. Copy the following values:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your cloud name
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your API key
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your API secret
4. Create an upload preset:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Upload
   - Create a new upload preset
   - Set it to "Unsigned" 
   - Copy the preset name to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`

#### AI Integration
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key

### 3. Database Setup

Push the database schema:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Cloudinary Setup Guide

1. **Create Account**: Visit [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and sign up
2. **Get Credentials**:

4. **Update Environment Variables**: Add all the Cloudinary credentials to your `.env.local`

## Features

- âœ… **Authentication**: Clerk integration for user management
- âœ… **File Storage**: Cloudinary for image uploads (replaces Firebase)
- âœ… **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- âœ… **AI Integration**: Google Gemini for course content generation
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Migration from Firebase

This project has been migrated from Firebase to Cloudinary:
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage â†’ Cloudinary
- **Database**: Still using PostgreSQL (no change needed)
- **Authentication**: Still using Clerk (no change needed)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure your Neon DB connection string is correct
2. **Cloudinary Upload Fails**: Check that your upload preset is set to "Unsigned"
3. **Authentication Issues**: Verify your Clerk keys are correctly set
4. **AI Generation Fails**: Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has quota

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run start`: Start production server
- `npm run db:push`: Push database schema
- `npm run db:studio`: Open Drizzle Studio

## Support

If you encounter any issues, please check:
1. All environment variables are properly set
2. Database connection is working
3. Cloudinary credentials are correct
